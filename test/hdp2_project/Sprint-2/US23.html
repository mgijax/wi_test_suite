    <h2>Test Requirements - Disease Detail & All Mouse Models page</h2>
	<ol>
	<h3>Disease Detail</h3>
	   <li>The basic display of the Disease Detail does not change.  The new roll-up rules alter the categorization of the markers and their models.  Markers may move to other sections on the page, be removed from the page, or be added to the page.</li>
	   <li>The following ribbons on the page should remain the same (data content and display)
	   <ol><li>Human Disease</li>
	       <li>Synonyms</li>
	       <li>View all models</li>
	       <li>References</li></ol>
	   <li>The basic rules for display, text, links, homologs, etc. of the Genes and mouse models ribbon does not change.
	   <ul><li>There are new rules to determine which category to display (or not) a mouse gene.   The rules have been re-implemented so need to test all cases.
	       <ol><li>Roll-up to a gene for OMIM annotations to a simple 1 marker (where marker type = gene) genotype.</li>
	           <li>Roll-up to a gene for OMIM annotations to a conditional genotype that has just 1 marker (where marker type = gene) when recombinase, transgenic reporter, and wild type alleles are factored out.</li>
	           <li>Roll-up to a gene for OMIM annotations to a complex genotype that has just 1 marker (where marker type = gene) when transgenic reporters are factored out.</li>
	           <li>Remove Gt(ROSA)26Sor from the rolled up set of genes.</li>
	           <li>Remove genes that have only NOT annotations from the rolled up set.</li>
	           <li>Note: differences with HMDC - slash alleles not removed; allele/disease annotations not included; transgenic reporter bug</li>
	       </ol></li>
	       <li>Rules for the display of Human genes have not changed -- human phenotypic markers should not be displayed.</li>
	   </ul></li>
	   <li>The basic rules for display, text, links of the Transgenes and other genome features ribbon does not change.
	   <ul><li>There are new rules to determine which category to display (or not) a transgene or other non-gene marker.
	       <ol><li>Same rules as above except for non-gene markers.</li></ol></li>
	   </ul></li>
	   <li>Mouse Models column pop-up - the rules to determine what models are included for each marker does not change.</li>
	   
	<h3>All Mouse Models page</h3>
	 <li>The basic display of the All Mouse Models page does not change.  The total number of models does not change.  The new roll-up rules alter the categorization of the models.  </li>
	 <li>The Disease phenotype not observed ribbon on the page should remain the same (data content and display).</li>
     <li>The basic rules for display, text, links, etc. of the Mouse models ribbon does not change.
	   <ul><li>There are new rules to determine which category to display each Mouse Model.
	       <ol><li>Same rules as above - both gene rules and other marker type rules.</li></ol></li>
	   </ul></li>
