    <h2>Test Requirements - Marker Detail & Homology Class</h2>
	<ol>
	<h3>Marker Detail</h3>
	   <li>The basic display of the Marker Detail & Homology Class pages does not change.  The new roll-up rules alter the diseases that MGI associates to a Marker.  The new rules add/remove from the current list.  These 2 pages should display the same list of diseases for the mouse and human markers.</li>
	   <li>The following ribbons/fields on the Marker Detail page are impacted by this change
	   <ol><li>Human homologs - "Diseases Associated with Human XXX"
	       <ul><li>Display an asterisk next to diseases that also are associated to the mouse homolog</li></ul></li>
	       <li>Mutations, alleles, and phenotypes - "Human Diseases Modeled Using Mouse Xxx"
	       <ul><li>Alter list of diseases per new rules</li></ul></li>
	   </ol></li>
	   <li>The "Associated Human Diseases" column for the mouse marker row(s) is impacted by this change 
	   <li>There are new rules to determine whether to roll-up the disease to a marker.   The rules have been re-implemented so need to test all cases.
	       <ol><li>Roll-up to a gene for OMIM annotations to a simple 1 marker genotype.</li>
	           <li>Roll-up to a gene for OMIM annotations to a conditional genotype that has just 1 marker when recombinase, transgenic reporter, and wild type alleles are factored out.</li>
	           <li>Roll-up to a gene for OMIM annotations to a complex genotype that has just 1 marker when transgenic reporters are factored out.</li>
	           <li>Do not associate any diseases to marker Gt(ROSA)26Sor.</li>
	           <li>Do not associate any diseases that have only NOT annotations from the rolled up set.</li>
	           
	       </ol></li>
	   <li>NOTE: differences with HMDC (until rules are updated) - slash alleles not removed; allele/disease annotations not included; transgenic reporter bug</li>
