    <h2>Test Requirements</h2>
	<ol>
	  
	   <li>Change the Marker QF/Summary to query the data that was "rolled-up" using the new implementation of the roll-up rules on the Production server instead of the HMDC data as currently implemented.
	       <ul><li>The results are expected to be the same for the most part.  Exceptions include: slash alleles not factored out; transgenic reporter bug (factoring out when multiple attributes exist)</ul> 
	   <li>The rules to determine whether to roll-up a OMIM or MP annotation to a marker and return it for a query are as follows.   The rules have been re-implemented so need to test all cases.
	       <ol><li>Roll-up to a gene for MP/OMIM annotations for a simple 1 marker genotype.</li>
	           <li>Roll-up to a gene for MP/OMIM annotations for a conditional genotype that has just 1 marker when recombinase, transgenic reporter, and wild type alleles are factored out.</li>
	           <li>Roll-up to a gene for MP/OMIM annotations to a complex genotype that has just 1 marker when transgenic reporters are factored out.</li>
	           <li>Do not return Gt(ROSA)26Sor as a match for any MP/OMIM annotations it may have.</li>
	           <li>Factor out MP annotations to MP:0003012; "no phenotypic analysis".</li>
	           <li>Do not return any markers for matches to normal MP or NOT OMIM annotations.</li>
	       </ol></li>
	   <li>Booleans, quotes, wildcards, etc (all UI features) should continue to work as before.</li>
	   <li>Rules for searching notes has not changed -- search QTL notes, general notes, and annotation notes (except those with a normal qualifier).
	      <ul><li>Bug fix - currently public version returns matches to normal annotation notes.</li></ul></li>
	   <li>Rules for searching Nomenclature unchanged -- regression testing required due to impact from re-implementation of the rules.</li>
	   <li>Stop words for Phenotype box -- ignore/factor out of any search not in quotes.  If only stop words exist treat as if nothing was entered in the box
	      <ul><li>Stop words = a, an, and, are, as, be, but, if, is, it, or, such, that, the, their, then, there, these, they, this, was, will</li>
	      </ul></li>
