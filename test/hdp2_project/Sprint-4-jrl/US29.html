	<ol>
	   <li>The new roll-up rules alter the diseases that MGI associates to a Marker.  The new rules add/remove from the current list.</li>
	   <li>This change impacts the list of diseases when "Human Disease (OMIM)" is selected from Additional Information.</li>
	   <li>The following rules are used to determine whether to roll-up the disease to a marker.   The rules have been re-implemented so need to test all cases.
	       <ol><li>Roll-up to a gene for OMIM annotations to a simple 1 marker genotype.</li>
	           <li>Roll-up to a gene for OMIM annotations to a conditional genotype that has just 1 marker when recombinase, transgenic reporter, and wild type alleles are factored out.</li>
	           <li>Roll-up to a gene for OMIM annotations to a complex genotype that has just 1 marker when transgenic reporters are factored out.</li>
	           <li>Do not associate any diseases to marker Gt(ROSA)26Sor.</li>
