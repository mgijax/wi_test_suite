    <h2>Test Requirements - Autocomplete and GXD QF/Summary</h2>
	<ol>
	   <li>Modify the GXD QF auto-complete gene counts for OMIM terms to include mouse homolog(s) of associated human genes.</li>
	   <li>Modify the GXD QF/Summary to query the data using the additional mouse homolog(s) of associated human genes.</li>
	   <li>There are no rules that modify this list of human homologs.</li>
	   <li>A mouse gene that was excluded via the "roll-up rules" may not be counted/searched due to its human gene/homolog association (e.g. Retinoblastoma - mouse marker Rb1)</li>
	   <li>There may be multiple mouse homologs for an annoted human gene. (e.g. lung cancer - Cyp2a4, Cyp2a5)</li>
	   <li>The GXD QF is the only query form that takes into account mouse homologs for an OMIM term</li>
	   <li>This should have no impact on MP term searches.</li>
	   <li>The link to the GXD Literature Results at the bottom of the GXD Summary page does not include the mouse homologs.  US 153 created for this work.</li>
