    <h2>Test Requirements</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Test the WI pages/fields using the new rolled-up data changed by EC/MI relationships.
       <li>Change label text for rolled up human disease list for a marker: "Human Diseases Modeled in Mice Using [symbol]"</li>
       <li>Marker Detail - reflect updated roll-up rules for OMIM
       <ol><li>Human Diseases Modeled in Mice Using [symbol]: add/remove per new rolled up data</li>
           <li>Asterisks on list of "Diseases Associated with Human [symbol]": add/remove per new rolled up data</li>
           <li><s>Disease relevant reference link: rolled up annotations + disease annoations to alleles of marker</s></li>
       </ol>
       <li>Disease Detail - should reflect updated roll-up rules for OMIM
       <ol><li>Mouse genes may be removed from this page - e.g. docking site markers</li>
           <li>Mouse genes may be added to this page - e.g. EC markers</li>
           <li>Transgenes may be added/removed from this page</li>
           <li>Mouse Models for EC markers are included in table</li>
       </ol></li>
       <li>All Mouse Models - should reflect updated roll-up rules for OMIM
       <ul><li>Same models displayed; but category of model may change with new rules</li></ul>
       <li>Homology Class - should reflect updated roll-up rules with EC/MI
       <ul><li>Should only change list of diseases associated to Mouse (no change to human list)</li></ul>
       <li>Batch Query - reflect updated roll-up rules for OMIM and MP
       <ol><li>List of MP annotations for a marker change with the new rules</li>
           <li>List of OMIM annotations for a marker change with the new rules</li>
       </ol></li>
       <li>Marker QF - reflect updated roll-up rules for queries by OMIM and MP terms</li>
       <li>GXD QF - reflect updated roll-up rules
       <ol><li>Autocomplete - count of markers for MP and OMIM terms change with new rules</li>
           <li>GXD Search - markers to search by change with new rules for OMIM and MP searches</li>
