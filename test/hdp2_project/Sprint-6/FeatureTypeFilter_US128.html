    <ul>
        <li>User Story 128 - Add Feature Type filter to HMDC</li>
    </ul>
</div>



<div id="acceptance">
    <h2>Test Requirements</h2>
    <ol>   
        <li>Filter mouse markers by Feature Type in the HMDC following the general paradigm of the GXD filters.</li>
        <li>New filter should work with existing row/column filter.  i.e. selecting a subset of rows from the results dynamically updates the list of features in the filter</li>
        <li>Apply filter to all HMDC Tab results
        <ul><li>Grid: keep matching mouse marker rows; keep human homologs of those markers</li>
            <li>Genes: keep matching mouse marker rows; keep human homologs of those markers (continue to just display the direct matches in this tab, right?)</li>
            <li>Diseases: keep diseases that are returned due to annotations to genes that match the filters</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Filter by Feature Type will remove all human genes that have no mouse homologs (i.e. a row with no mouse marker will never match any Feature Types).</li>
        <li>Move and re-label the current row/col 'remove' button to "Remove row/column filters".</li>
        <li>Add new filter button
        <ul><li>Button label= Feature Type</li>
            <li>Title of filter pop-up= Filter Mouse Genes by Feature Type</li>
            <li>Display= dynamic list of FTs that are present in the mouse markers in the returned grid</li>
            <li>Order= list in alpha order (case insensitive)</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Display a "remove" button for each filter type selected.
        <ul><li>Will there be a 'Remove all filters' button?</li></ul></li>
       
    </ol>
