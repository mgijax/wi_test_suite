    <h2>Test Requirements</h2>
    <ol>
         <li>Search MP and OMIM vocabularies with User's query and determine the set of OMIM and or MP terms to use for searching the annotations.</li>
         <li>Search the simple set of mouse genoclusters for annotations to the MP/OMIM term search set.</li>
         <li>Search the human gene/OMIM annotations for annotations to the OMIM term search set.</li>
         <li>Apply boolean operation if present (explicit AND, OR, AND NOT or implicit OR).</li>
         <li>Disease tab results
         <ol><li>For every genocluster that results, return all diseases with annotations to those resulting genoclusters.</li>
             <li>For every human gene that results, return all disease with annotations to those resulting human genes.</li>
             <li>For text or id searches - return OMIM terms that match the OMIM vocabulary (ids, synonyms, terms) even if nothing is returned for them in the grid tab.</li>
         </ol></li>
