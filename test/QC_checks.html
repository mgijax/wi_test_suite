		    <li>duplicate lines are found in the input file</li>
		    <li>duplicate MGI IDs are found in the input file</li>
		    <li>lines other than header record have fewer than 7 columns</li>
		    <li>required columns are blank</li>
		    <li>first column for other than the header record begins "MGI:"
		    
		</ol>
		<li>Accept and correct the following conditions in an input file during the QC check process.<ol>
		   <li>Columns 8-n may be used by curators with no impact to QC or Load
		   <li>Blank lines within the input file are ignored

		   <li>Double quotes within the input file are ignored
		</ol>
		<li>Reject on a line-by-line basis for the following conditions.  The overall QC check passes and the curators are informed via warning messages.
		<ol>

		    <li>chromosome is not a valid chromosome (i.e. 1-19, X, Y, XY are valid)
	        <li>coordinates are not numeric values
	        <li>strand is not +, -, or blank
		</ol>  
		<li>Report the following information to the curator during the QC check.  No data is rejected due to these conditions.<ol>
		   <li>list the marker when the chromosome in the input file does not match the chromosome for the marker in the database
		   <li>list the new 'source/display' pairs found in the input file that are not already in database
