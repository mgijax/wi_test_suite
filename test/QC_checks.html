		    <li>duplicate MGI IDs are found in the input file</li>
		    <li>lines other than header record have fewer than 7 columns</li>

		<ol>
		   <li>Columns 8-n may be used by curators with no impact to QC or Load</li>
		   <li>Blank lines within the input file are ignored</li>
		   <li>Ctrl-M characters are ignored (unprintable control character sometimes inserted  at the end of a line when moving a file from Windows to Unix/Linux)</li>
		</ol></li>
		<li>Report the following errors to the curator during the QC check.  Reject on a line-by-line basis for the following conditions.<ol>
