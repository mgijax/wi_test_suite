		    <li>duplicate MGI IDs are found in the input file</li>
		    <li>lines other than header record have fewer than 7 columns</li>
		    <li>required columns are blank</li>
		    <li>first column for other than the header record begins "MGI:"</li>
		    
		</ol>

		   <li>Columns 8-n may be used by curators with no impact to QC or Load</li>
		   <li>Blank lines within the input file are ignored</li>

	        <li>strand is not +, -, or blank</li>
		</ol>
