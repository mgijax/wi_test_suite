US189 Testing

Finish the front end of TR 12057 - support the weird RR ids in the quick search and the accession linking.

This user story specifically addresses the issue of searches in the Quick Search by the newly added RRIDs returning other objects that match the "MGI" component of the RRID (in particular the match to synonym "MGI-IGM" (synonym for Csf2) and MP terms with "MGI-2" contained in the term (MGI stands for "Macrophage and Granulocyte Inducer").

------------
Verify that Quick Search queries by RRIDs return only genotypes associated with corresponding RRIDs (genotypes that have annotations).

Test case1 (curator generated genotype)
Genotype
_genotype_key = 76478
Allelic Composition: Acox2<em1Pvv>/Acox2<em1Pvv>	
Genetic Background: C57BL/6N-Acox2<em1Pvv>
MGI ID: MGI:5749444
RRID: RRID:MGI:5749444



Test case2 (High Throughput MP Load created genotype)
Genotype
_genotype_key: 76097
Allelic Composition: Actn4<tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi>/Actn4<+> 	
Genetic Background: C57BL/6N-Actn4<tm1a(EUCOMM)Wtsi>/Wtsi
Cell Lines: EPD0525_2_B12
MGI ID: MGI:5705945
RRID: RRID:MGI:5705945


Test Result:
PASS



------------
Verify that Quick Search queries by MGI IDs for genotypes still return corresponding genotypes

Same test cases as above


Test Result:
PASS




------------
Verify that nomenclature searches that contain "RRI*" are not affected by the changes to searching by RRIDs.


Test cases
Queries by "RR*", "*RR", "RRI*"

Test Result:
PASS
