    <h2>Test Requirements</h2>
    <ol> 
       <li>Return SNPs for a marker in Batch Query (option in Additional Information radio buttons) OR from the Marker Detail page
       <ol><li>Return all SNPs associated to a marker via dbSNP function classes (regardless of distance from the marker).</li>
           <li>Return add'l SNPs that are located within 2 KB upstream or downstream (or proximal/distal) from the marker.</li>
           <li>Do not return any multiple location SNPS.</li>
           <li>Do not return any variation types other than SNP.  E.g. no IN-DEL, Mixed, etc.</li>
           <li>By policy we don't associate SNPs to certain types of markers: QTL, heritable phenotype, Cytogenetic.</li>
           <li>If a marker has no SNPs -- the SNP column is empty in Batch Query; No link in the Polymorphism ribbon on Marker Detail.</li>
       </ol></li>
       
       <li>Return Markers for a SNP (rs id) in Batch Query
       <ol><li>Return all Markers associated to the SNP via a dbSNP function class (regardless of distance from the SNP).</li>
           <li>Return all Markers located within 2 KB upstream or downstream (or proximal/distal) from the SNP.</li>
           <li>Do not return any markers for a SNP with multiple locations.</li>
           <li>Do not return any markers for a SNP with a variation other than SNP (e.g. IN-DEL, Mixed)</li>
           <li>Do not return any markers of type: QTL, heritable phenotype, Cytogenetic.</li>
           <li>If a SNP has no markers - return a row with no associated markers.</li>
       </ol></li>
       
       <li>Marker SNP Summary
       <ol><li>Display count on Marker Detail page -- count per inclusions/exclusions above.</li>
           <li>Display header on page - title, marker symbol w/link, marker name, mgi ID, user help link</li>
           <li>Summary -- same pagination, columns, sort order as SNP Summary from QF.  Further updates will need to be checked from both places.</li>
