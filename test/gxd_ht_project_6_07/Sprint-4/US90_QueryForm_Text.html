    <h2>Test Requirements</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Provide a text search of Experiment Title and Description.</li>
       <li>Allow users to search by either field or both.</li>
       <li>Each token a user entered has a wild card appended under the covers.  E.g. diabet child is treated as diabet* child*</li>
       <li>All special characters a user enters are ignored and treated as a space (except apostrophe).</li>
       <li>The text in the Index treats special characters as a space (except apostrophe).</li>
       <li>Apostrophe is treated as a null.  E.g. Parkinson's Disease -> Parkinsons Disease.</li>
       <li>The search uses the Solr proximity search -- so multiple tokens will match text in any order and aren't required to be abutting to match.</li>
       <li>When a search of multiple tokens is done of both Title and Description -- the software looks at both fields as one for matching.  So a partial match to each field can return a result.</li>
       <li>The search is case insensitive.</li>
       <li>Note: The Public WI search works differently than the search provided to the curators in the PWI.  A combination of multiple searches in the PWI comes close, but does not equal the WI search.</li>
    </ol>
