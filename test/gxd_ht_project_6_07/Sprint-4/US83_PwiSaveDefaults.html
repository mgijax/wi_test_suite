    <h2>Test Requirements</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Save the Sample data defaults when the user clicks on the Modify button.</li>
       <li>Set a blank curated Organism field to "mouse, laboratory".</li>
       <li>When the curated Organism field has a value -- leave it as is.</li>
       <li>Set a blank curated Gxd? (i.e. relevance) field to "Yes" when the curated Organism field is "mouse, laboratory".</li>
       <li>Set a blank curated Gxd? field to "Non-mouse sample; no data stored" when the curated Organism field is anything other than "mouse, laboratory".</li>
       <li>When the curated Gxd? field has a value -- leave it as is.</li>
       <li>Set a blank curated Sex field to "Not Specified" when Gxd? is Yes.</li>
       <li>Set a blank curated Sex field to "Not Applicable" when Gxd? is anything but Yes.</li>
       <li>When the curated Sex field has a value -- leave it as is.</li>
       <li>Set EMAPA and stage_key to null</li>
       <li>Set the curated Name field to the raw Source Name field.  If it has been modified in the table - save the modified text.</li>
       <li>The Note field is in a different table -- that field is not saved as part of this story.</li>
       <li>Genotype & Age: set to Not Specified/Not Applicable for this story; same rules as Gxd? for now.</li>
       <li>Experiment attributes that may be curated can be modified/saved at the same time as the curated Sample data.</li>
