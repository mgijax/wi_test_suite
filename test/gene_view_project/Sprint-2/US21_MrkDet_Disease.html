<div id="acceptance">
    <h2>Test Requirements</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Create new Marker Detail ribbon named "Disease" and list it after the "Homology" ribbon when data exists.</li>
      <li>The new ribbon lists diseases that are rolled up to a mouse marker and/or associated to its human homolog(s).</li>
      <li>Diseases are displayed in a table in concordance order (mouse; human/mouse; human); secondary is alpha order  by term with the following columns
      <ol><li>Icons: mouse, human, or both -- display icons to represent the associations</li>
          <li>OMIM ID</li>
          <li>Human Disease - display OMIM term; link to disease detail</li>
          <li>Mouse Models Involving Xxx -- Number of mouse models; should match the count displayed on the Disease Detail; includes complex models</li>
          <li>Human Homologs Associated with the Disease* -- Human homolog symbol (each occurrence includes an asterisk)</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Display count of diseases associated to mouse models for the Mouse Marker (rolled up count).</li>
      <li>Display count of diseases associated to human homolog(s).</li>
      <li>Display count and link to disease references.</li>
      <li>When multiple homologs exist for a mouse marker
      <ol><li>Combine counts of human diseases associated with all homologs.</li>
          <li>Display comma delimited list of human homologs that have diseases (may not be all of the homologs)</li>
          <li>Display appropriate human homolog symbol in last column.</li>
      </ol></li>
      <li>When a mouse marker is part of a homology set with multiple mouse markers (e.g. C4a, C4b) use the same rules as above.</li>
      
    
    </ol>
