Change HomoloGene cluster page details

Test environment:
http://scrumbob.informatics.jax.org

1) Testing Requirements

1a) Change HomoloGene Vertebrate Homology Page title
From:
Vertebrate Homology Class
To:
HomoloGene Vertebrate Homology

1b) Change text in the Homology Information popup button and in the popup itself to indicate HomoloGene is the source.
From:
MGI Homology Information
To:
MGI HomoloGene Information

1c) Incorporate links to MGI HNGC Homology Pages in the Gene Links column


1d) Inspect that other parts of the page work expectedly




2) Testing

2a) Verify the change of HomoloGene Vertebrate Homology Page title
From:
Vertebrate Homology Class
To:
HomoloGene Vertebrate Homology


Result: PASS 2/27/15 - rmb



2b) Verify the text change in the Homology Information popup button and in the popup itself to indicate HomoloGene is the source.
From:
MGI Homology Information
To:
MGI HomoloGene Information

Result: PASS 2/27/15 - rmb

	Mouse
2c) Verify incorporate links to MGI HNGC Homology Pages in the Gene Links column

2c1) Verify display of "HGNC Homology" link in Gene Links column for corresponding genes in HomoloGene clusters.

Test Case1: HomoloGene Class ID: 133076

Gene Symbol	Species
2610305D13Rik	Mouse
Gm13051	Mouse
Gm13139	Mouse
Gm13154	Mouse
Gm13157	Mouse
Gm13212	Mouse (has HGNC cluster)
Gm13242	Mouse
Gm13247	Mouse
Gm13251	Mouse
Gm30910	Mouse
Rex2	Mouse
Zfp534	Mouse
Zfp600	Mouse
ZNF616	Human  (has HGNC cluster)

Corresponding HGCN Cluster:
Gene Symbol	Species
Gm13212	Mouse
ZNF268	Human
ZNF616	Human

Expected result:
HGNC homology links displayed only for human ZNF616 and mouse Gm13212.

Result: PASS 4/10/14 - rmb




Test Case2: HomoloGene Class ID: 87808

ClusterKey	Symbol	Species
2249735	Ranbp2	Mouse
2249735	RGPD1	Human
2249735	RGPD2	Human
2249735	RGPD3	Human
2249735	RGPD4	Human
2249735	RGPD5	Human
2249735	RGPD6	Human
2249735	RGPD8	Human

Note: Human RANBP2 is in a different HomoloGene Cluster (HG ID: 136803)

Corresponding HGCN Clusters:

ClusterKey	Symbol	Species
2267746	RGPD5	Human

2278837	RGPD1	Human

2282199	RGPD6	Human

2288615	RGPD4	Human

2294408	RGPD8	Human

2294421	RGPD2	Human

2294437	RGPD3	Human

2300450	Ranbp2	Mouse
2300450	RANBP2	Human

Expected result:
HGNC homology links only for all human and mouse genes in the HG cluster (all to separate HGNC Homology pages)

Result: PASS 4/10/14 - rmb


2c2) Verify that the HGNC Homology links are directed to the appropriate MGI HGNC Homology pages

Test Case1: HomoloGene Class ID: 133076 (same as above)
Expected result:
HGNC homology links for only for human ZNF616 and mouse Gm13212, go to the correct HGCN cluster pages.

Result: PASS 2/27/15 - rmb


Test Case2: HomoloGene Class ID: 87808 (same as above)
Expected result:
HGNC homology links for all human and mouse genes go to the correct HGCN cluster pages.

Result: PASS 2/27/15 - rmb



2d) Inspect that other parts of the page work expectedly

Testing Note:
On Scrum Bob, it looks like the links to the Comparative GO Graph are missing.  Jon indicated that this might be a config issue for our Scrum Bob setup.  This issue is not related to the changes implemented for US91.

Result: PASS 4/10/14 - rmb
