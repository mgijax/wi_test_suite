TR11696 (Sequence to Gene Association Problem)

The solution has two parts.
1) Remove all the XM_ sequences associated with MGI genes using J:90438.  This is the MGI curation reference that the Sequence Group uses to assign coordinates to a sequence and also for sequence-marker associations.

2) Run the load sequence of: entrezgene loads followed by the cache loads.

Testing strategy.

1) Check that XM_ sequence associations with markers using J:90438 have been deleted.

2) Check that the SEQ_Marker_Cache table has been populated by RefSeqs via the entrezgene load.



Testing

1) Verify removal of XM_ sequence to marker associations with association reference J:90438.

1a) Check that XM_ to marker associations from J:90438 are absent from the accession table (ACC_Accession).

select _Accession_key
into #tt1
from ACC_AccessionReference
where _Refs_key = 91423

||
create index idx1 on #tt1(_Accession_key)
||

select t1._Accession_key, a._Object_key, a.accID
into #tt2
from #tt1 t1, ACC_Accession a
where a._LogicalDB_key = 27
and a.prefixPart = "XM_"
and a._MGIType_key = 2
and t1._Accession_key = a._Accession_key

||
create index idx2 on #tt2(_Object_key, accID)
||

select count(*)
from #tt2

1b) Check XM_ to marker associations from J:90438 are absent from the SEQ_Marker_Cache table.

select count(distinct _Sequence_key)
from SEQ_Marker_Cache
where _Refs_key = 91423
and _LogicalDB_key = 27
and accID like "XM_%"

2) Verify that SEQ_Marker_Cache has been populated by RefSeqs via the entrezgene load.


select count(*)
from SEQ_Marker_Cache
where _Refs_key = 64047
and _LogicalDB_key = 27
and accID like "NM_%"


Results from sybase : DEV_MGI..mgd
140326


Results from sybase : DEV_MGI..mgd_bob 
140689


Note: _Refs_key = 64047 is J:63103 (the Entrez Gene Load)
Additional counts are expected from DEV_MGI..mgd_bob, since they would take the place of deleted XM_ to marker associations from J:90438.

Test result: PASS
