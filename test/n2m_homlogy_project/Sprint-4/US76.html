	   <li>Display Genes and Mouse Models ribbon on the Disease Detail page
	   <ol>
           <li>only display the homologs/models table if there's at least 1 gene associated to the disease</li>
           <li>display bold text line at top of ribbon as in mockup</li>
           <li>display associated human genes even when no associated mouse homolog (this is a bug right now on Public - these are not displayed, but should be)</li>
           <li>when there are no human or mouse genes associated to a disease display a special message - use the same one as on Public now</li>	   
	   </ol></li>

	   <ol><li>The table has 3 sections: mouse and human, mouse, human.  Only display the section if data exists</li>

	       <li>A row in this table represents any of the following cases:
	          <ul><li>homology class that has at least 1 member that is associated to the disease (and you display all human and mouse members)</li>
	              <li>mouse gene associated to the disease, but not in a homology class</li>

	           <li>Order the list of markers -- alpha order of markers associated to disease, remaining markers not associated to disease also in alpha order.</li>
	           <li>The human symbols are not linked anywhere (just text)</li>
	           <li>When there are no human homologs for a mouse gene associated to the disease - leave the column blank for that row</li>

	   <li>Criteria for including a Mouse Gene in the "Genes" section of the Disease Detail page
	       <ol>
	          <li>Mouse marker must have a Marker Type = Gene</li>
	          <li>Mouse marker must not be associated via an allele that is has a Driver Note (Cre)</li>
	          <li>Mouse marker must not be associated via a genotype that has a NOT qualifier</li>
	          <li>Mouse marker must not be associated via a Complex genotype that is NOT also conditional</li>
