    <h2>Test Requirements</h2>
	<ol>
	   <li>Add new "all models" ribbon to the Disease Detail page - "View all models"
	   <ol><li>Add ribbon when there's at least one model to display</li>
	       <li>Count is the positive number of models (matching QuickSearch and OMIM Browser)</li>
	       <li>If NOTs are the only models present -- use that number as the count</li>
	       <li>Display text and link:
	       <ul><li>"View ALL (nn) mouse models for this human disease"</li>
	           <li>"View ALL (nn) "NOT" mouse models for this human disease.  No mouse models with similarity to the expected human disease phenotype are reported in MGI.</li>
	       </ul></li>
       </ol></li>
       
       <li>Create new page in fewi -- Mouse Models of <i>'disease name'</i>
       <ol><li>Use standard toolbar at top of page</li>
           <li>Link to a new user doc - get name from David S.</li>
           <li>Display text and link to OMIM at top of first ribbon, Mouse Models.</li>
           <li>Display the first ribbon and the link to OMIM even if no positive models exist.</li>
           <li>When no models exist include in italics, <i>No mouse models with similarity to the expected human disease phenotype are reported in MGI.</i></li>
       </ol></li>
       
       <li>The new Mouse Models page has 2 sections - 'Mouse models' & 'Disease phenotype not observed'</li>
       
       <li>The Mouse models ribbon contains all models (i.e. genotypes) associated to the disease organized in 6 sections. Only include section if there's an applicable model.
       <ol><li>Both human/mouse</li>
           <li>Mouse only</li>
           <li>Human only</li>
           <li>Transgenes/others</li>
           <li>Additional complex
           <ol><li>Distinct list of models not included in the above sections.</li>
               <li>Includes Cre and Gt(ROSA) models that were excluded by the new rules</li>
           </ol></li>
           <li>General rules for all both, mouse, human and transgene sections
           <ol><li>Display distinct list of models included in same section on Disease Detail page. (no dups)</li>
               <li>Okay for a model to be displayed in multiple sections if applicable (just like DD page)</li>
               <li>Order - leave as is currently working; each section replicates the pop-up order, but without duplicates</li>
                <li>Striping - stripe each section instead of by row</li>
           </ol></li>
       </ol></li>
       
       <li>The NOT models ribbon contains a list of all NOT models
       <ol><li>If there are no NOT models - don't display this ribbon.</li>
      </ol></li>
       
       <li>Both ribbons display the same table with the same columns/same data as the model pop-ups on the Disease Detail page
       <ol><li>Allelic Composition</li>
           <li>Genetic Background</li>
           <li>Reference</li>
           <li>Phenotype (link should bring up new tab sense there is no toolbar on this page)</li>
       </ol></li>
